Not-comprehensive change-log

Various changes in this commit may have broken various integration tests and so on

 - Recreated the MySQL database
	As a result, all previous entries were lost
 - Commented out JUnit being in "test" scope in POM.xml (causes build errors otherwise); consider moving JUnit tests to the /test directory instead, then revert this change ...

Related fixes regarding majors becoming entities:
	- Work requirements no longer reference Student and instead reference Major
	- Student /show page updated accordingly
	- Major /show page updated accordingly
	- Executed Spring Roo command to generate the major controller and related scaffolding
	- Added converter for Major to String
	- WorkTemplateController.java modified so that work requirements can be added to majors instead of students properly
	Later, it would make sense to add in the ability to add a major to a student in a similar fashion ...

Related to issue #8:
	- ROLE_USER (student) users should no longer see the horizontal menu bar
	
Security related:
	- ROLE_SUPERUSER users should now be able to see the admin menu and other related menus
	
Student query related:
	- Added ability to search by user id, catalog term (returns a student if any of the student's majors match that catalog term), graduation term, modification date, major, and milestone
	- Student query validator updated accordingly
	- A term validator was added in the process of updating the student query validator
	- Currently there is no link going to the student query, go to RebelHotel/students?query to test it
